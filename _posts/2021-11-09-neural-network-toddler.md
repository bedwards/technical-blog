# Building a Neural Network Feels Like Teaching a Toddler Calculus

When I first implemented backpropagation from scratch, I had this moment where I realized neural networks are basically just very expensive ways to approximate functions. You're essentially telling the computer "here's a bunch of examples, figure out the pattern" and hoping it doesn't just memorize everything like that one student who could recite the textbook but couldn't solve a single novel problem.

The thing that kills me about modern deep learning is how we've collectively agreed to pretend we understand why batch normalization works. Sure, we have these hand-wavy explanations about internal covariate shift, but really we just know it makes training more stable and we're all too afraid to question it. It's like how medieval blacksmiths knew that quenching steel in urine made better swords - they had theories about spirits and essences, but really they were just accidentally adding nitrogen. We're doing the same thing with neural networks, just with fancier math.

My favorite part of training models is watching the loss curve and trying to diagnose what's going wrong from its shape. That sudden spike at epoch 47? Your learning rate is too high and you just catapulted over a minimum. That plateau that looks like Kansas? You're stuck in a saddle point and need to add some noise. That perfect exponential decay that suddenly explodes? Congratulations, you've encountered the dreaded gradient explosion, and your weights are now NASA's problem because they've achieved escape velocity.
